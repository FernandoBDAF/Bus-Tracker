#Real Time Bus Tracker

I added markers after 15 seconds to track the route of each bus. For that matter, I choose a color for the marker according to the ID of the bus and I also add a tag to track the insertion time. On top of that, I save pointers to all markers to further improvements such as hiding/showing in the map.

I did these changes because I would like to keep track of the route instead of only the instant position, but having the instant location of all buses or the tracks of the routes is another improvement I will make in the next version.

[x] show time runing
[ ] button to choose real time position only or follow route
[x] show list of buses by id
[x] function to hide/show markers of a specific bus
[ ] show detailed informations of each bus in the list
[ ] improve desing
